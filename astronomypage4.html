<h2>FACTS ABOUT ASTRONOMY</h2>

<h3><ul>
<li>There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. </li>
<li>Despite its appearance in the night sky, our natural satellite is nowhere near round. In fact, the Moon is shaped like a lemon, 
with flattened poles and bulges on both the near and far side around its equator.</li>
<li>One teaspoonful of neutron star would weigh the same as the entire human population.</li>
</ul></h3>
<br>
<h3><ul>
<li>As regions of space are whizzing away from one another at an ever-increasing rate, the first population of stars to form 
in the Universe are now too far away for us to ever hope of spying them.</li>
<li>Black holes are known for their voracious appetites; their influence is so strong that even light can’t escape their gravity. 
But they have a theoretical converse – white holes.</li>
<li>Neptune has only completed one orbit around the Sun since its discovery</li>
</ul></h3>
<br>
<h3><ul>
<li>Planets can wander through space without a parent star</li>
<li>Particles in the Sun’s upper atmosphere are so hot and energetic that they speed out into space as part of the solar wind.</li>
<li>Over half of the Sun-like stars in the Milky Way are part of multiple star systems, binaries or triplets, with stars orbiting around a common centre of mass.</li>
</ul></h3>
